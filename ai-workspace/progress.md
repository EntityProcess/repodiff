# Progress Report

## Implemented Features

### C# Method-Aware Filtering
- Added `include_method_body` and `include_signatures` options to `FilterRule`
- Implemented C# parser using tree-sitter for method detection
- Added Change Context Mode for C# files:
  - Includes full method bodies for changed methods
  - Includes method signatures within context range
  - Preserves standard context lines around changes
- Added dependencies:
  - tree-sitter v0.20.10
  - tree-sitter-c-sharp v0.20.0

### Next Steps
1. Improve file content retrieval:
   - Currently reconstructing file content from hunks
   - Need to implement proper file content retrieval from Git
2. Add tests for C# method-aware filtering
3. Add API Signature Mode implementation
4. Add Combined Mode implementation
